This repository contains the STM32CubeMX part database. Also tracking the historical ("olddb") data.

Be cautious of the license under which these files are provided... this repository is not official or endorsed by ST, but it is there to be a service to developers using the STM32 ecosystem, without the need to use cumbersome windows exe/installer digging. :)
