## Schematic symbol creation

- Click on the Symbol Editor button
- Create new library: File/New Library
- Choose between Global and Project
- The new library is added to the Libraries list (sorted alphabetically)
- Right click on the new library and New Symbol
- Give the symbol a name and click OK
- Go to the component's datasheet and take note of the pins
- Drop all the pins: click on Add pins to symbol
- Follow the datasheet and give each pin a name and number, for instance ICM7555's pin 1 is GND
- Inverted pins are denoted by a ~ before its name, for instance ICM7555's pin 2 is ~TRIG
- Define the electrical type of the pin
- To edit pin, press E (edit)
- Orientate the pins and draw a rectangle
- Other components connect to the circle in the pin
- To correct the rectangle, press G (grab)
- To add a background color, press E over the line that makes the rectangle
- Save and close the window
